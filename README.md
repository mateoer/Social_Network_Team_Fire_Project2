# RevatureProject2TeamFire

## Project Description

Our goal is to build a social networking platform, where you can share your opinions on different forms of media. We did this by having our posts centered around a review item and then attributing a review score to it. All people, including friends, can comment on the post to share their thoughts on the post as well.

## Technologies Used

* Spring Boot, Web, Beans, Context, WebMVC, Test - version 2.6.3
* ProjectLombok - version 2.6.3
* PostgreSQL - version 2.6.3
* JacksonDatabind - version 2.6.3
* AWS - S3, EC2, and RDS

## Features

List of features ready
* Post to your profile a review of a piece of media
* View, Comment, and Like other's reviews
* Sort through the posts by different values

To-do list:
* Add YouTube's API to have trailer's of the specified media show on the website.
* Add user rankings based on many likes their reviews get.

## Getting Started

> git clone https://github.com/Calihar/RevatureProject2TeamFire.git  
> Ensure that the ENV variables are set up to match the ones asked for by the application.yml
> This project uses AWS's S3, EC2, and RDS, so ensure that the endpoints are set up for your personal DB and S3 bucket.

## Usage

> To use this project, you can deploy it on a personal machine with a forwarded port or can use EC2 to deploy on an Amazon machine.
> If you decide to use it, then I am glad it could be of service to you.
>To properly use this project, you will need to set up system ENV variables that your IDE will read on start-up. They need to be mapped to the user name and password connected to the data base. You will also need to have an endpoint:port that directs you to the database.
